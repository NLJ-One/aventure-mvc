## üéØ Project Goal

This project serves as a practical exercise in software architecture. The initial version intentionally places all application logic within a single JavaScript file (`src/app.js`).

The primary goal is to **refactor this code** into a clean and maintainable MVC architecture, separating concerns into three distinct components:
-   **Model (`model.js`):** To manage the application's data (the questions, the current score).
-   **View (`view.js`):** To handle the presentation logic and what the user sees.
-   **Controller (`controller.js`):** To act as the intermediary, handling user input and updating the model and view accordingly.

## ‚ú® Features

-   A series of true/false questions about core MVC concepts.
-   Instant feedback on your answers.
-   Real-time score tracking.
-   Simple, clean, and responsive UI built with vanilla web technologies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Tooling:** No build tools or external libraries required.

2.  **Create a new Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/mvc-refactor`
3.  **Make your changes:** The main task is to move the logic from `src/app.js` into `src/model.js`, `src/view.js`, and `src/controller.js`.
4.  **Commit your changes:** `git commit -m 'feat: Refactor logic to MVC pattern'`
5.  **Push to the Branch:** `git push origin feature/mvc-refactor`
